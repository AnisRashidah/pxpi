Give up to use gstreamer, since I can't make it low latency and the coding of gst-launch is difficult to me. 

The code of raspicam.sh is work but not well in low bandwidth.

I changed to use pycamera with opencv. The code is [here](https://github.com/rc-bellergy/pxpi/tree/master/home/pi/jpeg-stream)
